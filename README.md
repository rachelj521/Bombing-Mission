# Dodge Bomb

**WELCOME TO DODGE BOMB!**

A simple 2D platform game built using Phaser 3's Webpack project template.

Collect as many stars as possible while jumping across platforms! Easy right? Just make sure to dodge the bombs using arrow keys! 

When a full set of 12 stars are collected, an additional bomb will drop. Difficulty increases as the player progresses on their star hunt.

This game was built using Javascript and HTML5 with the guidance of a Phaser 3 tutorial. 

## Starting up the game:

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from the root directory of the project. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.
