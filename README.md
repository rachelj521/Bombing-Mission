# Dodge Bomb

*** A Phaser 3 project template with ES6 support via [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) that includes hot-reloading for development and production-ready builds.


**WELCOME TO DODGE BOMB!**

A simple 2D platform game built using Phaser 3's Webpack project template.

Collect as many stars as possible while jumping across platforms! Easy right? Just make sure to dodge the bombs! 

When a full set of 12 stars are collected, an additional bomb will drop. Difficulty increases as the player progresses on their star hunt.

This game was built using Javascript and HTML5 with the guidance of a Phaser 3 tutorial.
